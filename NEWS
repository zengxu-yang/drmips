v2.0.4
------

* Fix an issue in the ForwardingUnit (thanks FOX and professor MAN from Hong
  Kong).


v2.0.3
------

* Added Brazilian Portuguese translation to the PC version of the simulator
  (thanks crcpucmg).


v2.0.2
------

General:
* Fixed Bug #5, concerning a forwarding issue in the Register Bank
  (thanks Macmod)

Android:
* Target API version 25


v2.0.1
------

* Rewrote the manuals in HTML, dropping the build dependency on LaTeX.


v2.0.0
------

General:
* Custom CPU components can now be provided along with the CPU files and used
  by them
* The simulator now requires Java version 7 (up from version 6)
* The Java package names of the simulator where simplified

Android:
* Minimum required Android version increased to 4.0
* Dialogs are now built using Fragments, which should make them more robust

Note:
The Java packages of the simulator were renamed.
Because of this, the new version will be started with the default settings.
Additionally, the new version of the Android application will be installed
alongside the old version, instead of upgrading, so you will have to uninstall
the old version manually. Don't forget to backup your custom CPU and code files
before uninstalling!

Also note the names of the CPU components where changed (i.e. the values of
the "type" fields are different).


v1.3.2
------

* Moved the project to GitHub


v1.3.1
------

PC version:
* Disabled OpenGL hardware acceleration by default, and added an option to
  enable it (Bug BB-20)
* Switched to JOpt Simple to parse command-line arguments
* Added the "--reset" command-line argument that resets all settings to their
  defaults
* Handle uncaught exceptions properly


v1.3.0
------

General:
* Improved the readability and color scheme of the simulator (Bug BB-17)
* The assembled code table is now scrolled automatically to the instruction(s)
  currently being executed
* The inputs/outputs that are in the critical path are now highlighted in the
  tooltips of the components while in performance mode
* Added an option to display the names in the input/output tips
* Added an option to display the input/output tips for all components
* The input/output tips are now visible in performance mode as well

PC version:
* Added zoom controls to the datapath, including an auto-resize
  option (Bug BB-9)
* Improved the "internal windows" mode by using jScroll. It now has
  scrollbars, a toolbar to select windows, and options to tile and cascade
  windows (Bug BB-18)
* On exit, the simulator will now remember whether the window was maximized
  and its non-maximized size
* Added an option to show an 80 columns margin line in the code editor
* Added a status bar to the code editor that displays the caret's position
* Added an option to open the last file at startup
* The "print" feature now prints with the correct colors (Bug BB-3)
* Fixed wrong title being displayed in GNOME 3 (Bug BB-15). The fix doesn't
  work in older GNOME versions
* OpenGL hardware acceleration enabled, which should improve the performace,
  particularly in Linux

Android version:
* Converted the Android project to Android Studio


v1.2.3
------

PC version:
* JTattoo, RSyntaxTextArea and Autocomplete libraries are now compiled from
  source and included inside of the JAR file

* Removed a library that was not being used


v1.2.2
------

* Support Java 6


v1.2.1
------

* Added Portuguese translation of the configuration manual
* Improved the descriptions of the components
* Renamed the identifiers of the components and inputs
* Replaced JSON.org library with a free version


v1.2.0
------

* Fixed a bug where the calculation of the critical path would fail when the
  latencies of all components were 0
* Separated the cross-platform simulator code from the PC and Android projects
  into a new project
* Some refactoring


v1.1.1
------

General:
* Added credits to the "about" dialogs
* Switched to CMake build system to compile the simulator from the command-line

PC version:
* Added some command-line arguments to the PC version


v1.1.0
------

* The critical path of the current instruction can now be displayed.
  The global critical path of the CPU is still available


v1.0.6
------

PC version:
* Fixed problems with Windows network (UNC) paths (Bug BB-1)


v1.0.5
------

* All inputs that are only used at the end of the clock cycle now correctly
  don't affect the component's latency


v1.0.4
------

* Workaround for wrong latencies in Register Bank


v1.0.3
------

General:
* The tooltip of the ALU in the datapath now displays the operation it's
  performing
* Updated the latencies of the components to more "realistic" values

PC version:
* Added a user manual in English and Portuguese
* Corrected some translations


v1.0.2
------

General:
* Added an option to view some execution statistics
